# Typical Meteorological Year (TMY)

This repository features a prototype code designed to create visual plots of average wind direction over a typical meteorological year, using data sourced from the PVGIS API. It's a straightforward tool for visualizing wind trends, useful for students, hobbyists, and professionals interested in meteorology and renewable energy. Explore how wind patterns unfold throughout the year with our easy-to-understand plots
